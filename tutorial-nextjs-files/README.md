**ℹ️ This project is used as a starting point for [a getting started tutorial](https://docs.stackbit.com/getting-started/nextjs-markdown) using markdown files (Git CMS) as the content source.**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you are using Node v14 or newer.

## Project Setup

Use the `create-stackbit-app` command to create a new project:

    npx create-stackbit-app@latest --example tutorial-nextjs-files

This will create a new instance of this project in a `tutorial-nextjs-files` directory and install dependencies. Change into the new directory and start the development server.

    cd tutorial-nextjs-files
    npm run dev

Visit `localhost:3000` and you should see the example content. Now you can continue with the tutorial!
