# Stackbit Next.js Starter

Begin a new Stackbit project or learn to add Stackbit to an existing site.

## Getting Started

Get up and running quickly by running the following command:

```txt
npx create-stackbit-app [project-name]
```

Then change into `[project-name]` directory (default: `my-stackbit-site`) and start the Next.js dev server and Stackbit local dev in separate terminal tabs/windows.

```txt
cd [project-name]
npm run dev

# in a separate tab/window
npm run stackbit-dev
```

## Learn the Basics
