# Nuxt 3 Example (Early Preview)

This is a early preview release for a Nuxt 3-based site.

Nuxt 3 is in Release Candidate status at the time of writing, so only a basic demo (a page with a single `title` field) is provided. However, [content reload](https://docs.stackbit.com/reference/automatic-content-reload/) is handled properly in an efficient manner.

## Quickstart

To launch a development server on your machine:

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd stackbit-examples/nuxt3-preview`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`

### Stackbit Local Development

Install the Stackbit CLI. Then open a new terminal window in the same project directory and run the Stackbit Dev server:

    npm install -g @stackbit/cli@latest
    stackbit dev

This outputs your own Stackbit URL. Open this URL, register or sign in, and you will be directed to Stackbit's visual editor for your new project. [Learn more about local development with Stackbit](https://docs.stackbit.com/how-to-guides/local-development/).
