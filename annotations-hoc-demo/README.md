This is a minimal starting point for new Stackbit projects. It is built with Next.js and equipped with visual editing capabilities using Stackbit. It uses markdown files as the content source. See below for [other Stackbit example projects](#other-stackbit-projects).

**âš¡ Demo:** [stackbit-nextjs-starter.netlify.app](https://stackbit-nextjs-starter.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

The typical development process is to begin by working locally.

Create local Stackbit project from this repo:

```txt
npx create-stackbit-app@latest --starter nextjs
```

Run the Next.js development server:

```txt
cd my-stackbit-site
npm run dev
```

Install the Stackbit CLI. Then open a new terminal window in the same project directory and run the Stackbit Dev server:

```txt
npm install -g @stackbit/cli
stackbit dev
```

This outputs your own Stackbit URL. Open this, register or sign in, and you will be directed to Stackbit's visual editor for your new project.
