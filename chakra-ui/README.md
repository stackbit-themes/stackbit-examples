# Stackbit Chakra UI Next.js Starter

A simple starting point for a Stackbit project that includes support for [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

## Features

This is meant to be a simple starting point that demonstrates the use of bringing your own component library, such as [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

In addition to Chakra UI support, this project contains the following:

- **Flexible Pages:** Simple and flexible page model that lets editors add new pages.
- **Basic Components:** A few diferent components (hero, pricing, stats, etc ) to add to new pages.
- **Layout Elements:** Header and footer elements automatically added to pages.
- **Component & Template Presets:** Predefined arrangements of content and components for faster editing. [Learn more](https://docs.stackbit.com/conceptual-guides/content-presets/).

## Quickstart

Use `create-stackbit-app` to create a new local project:

    npx create-stackbit-app@latest --example chakra-ui
    cd chakra-ui

Then you can run the Next.js development server:

    npm run dev

### Stackbit Local Development

Install the Stackbit CLI. Then open a new terminal window in the same project directory and run the Stackbit Dev server:

    npm install -g @stackbit/cli
    stackbit dev

This outputs your own Stackbit URL. Open this, register or sign in, and you will be directed to Stackbit's visual editor for your new project. [Learn more about local development with Stackbit](https://docs.stackbit.com/how-to-guides/local-development/).
